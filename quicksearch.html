InstallationNpmUse npm for nodejs, webpack or browserify: $ npm install dropbox --saveScript tagThe UMD build is available on unpkg: &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/dropbox/dist/Dropbox-sdk.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;You can find the library on window.Dropbox. UsageBrowser with &lt;script&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/dropbox/dist/Dropbox-sdk.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; var dbx = new Dropbox({ accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE' }); dbx.filesListFolder({path: ''}) .then(function(response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function(error) { console.log(error); }); &lt;/script&gt;Nodejs, Browserify or Webpackvar Dropbox = require('dropbox'); var dbx = new Dropbox({ accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE' }); dbx.filesListFolder({path: ''}) .then(function(response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function(error) { console.log(error); });General documentationEndpointsFor documentation of all of the available endpoints, the parameters they receive and the data they return, see the Dropbox class definition. These methods are all available directly from an instance of the API class, ex: dbx.filesListFolder(). TeamsThe Dropbox API has a series of actions that can be completed on a team wide level. These endpoint methods are available by using the DropboxTeam class. It can be loaded like this: var DropboxTeam = require('dropbox/team');. For more information , see the DropboxTeam class definition. AuthenticationThe Dropbox SDK uses OAuth 2 for authorizing API requests. Dropbox requires an access token to make authenticated requests. The access token can be supplied at instantiation or set later using the setAccessToken() method. Dropbox.getAuthenticationUrl() is a method that is very helpful for authenticating users. See the authentication example for a basic example of how it can be used. Dropbox.authenticateWithCordova() is a method that simplifies authentication from a Cordova / PhoneGap application. var dbx = new Dropbox({ clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY_HERE' }); dbx.authenticateWithCordova( function(accessToken) { console.log(accessToken); }, function() { console.log(&quot;failed&quot;); });The method requires the cordova inappbrowser plugin. $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowserFor more information on how to obtain an access token using OAuth, please see our OAuth Guide. Promises implementationThe SDK returns Promises using the native Promise implementation and polyfills with jakearchibald/es6-promise when needed. ExamplesSee examples/ for working examples of how the SDK can be used in a few different environments. VersioningWe will try to follow semver as close as possible. That means bug fixes will be patch releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 1.0.2), additional functionality like new endpoints will be minor releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 1.1.0) and breaking changes to both the library and the API endpoints it hits, will be major releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 2.0.0). × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on 2017-07-21T12:58:10-07:00 using the DocStrap template.

If the result's ListFolderResult.has_more field is true, call list_folder/continue with the returned ListFolderResult.cursor to retrieve more entries. If you're using ListFolderArg.recursive set to true to keep a local cache of the contents of a Dropbox account, iterate through each entry in order and process them as follows to keep your local state in sync: For each FileMetadata, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it and remove all its children. For each FolderMetadata, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it but leave the children as they are. Check the new entry's FolderSharingInfo.read_only and set all its children's read-only statuses to match. For each DeletedMetadata, if your local state has something at the given path, remove it and all its children. If there's nothing at the given path, ignore this entry. Note: auth.RateLimitError may be returned if multiple list_folder or list_folder/continue calls with same parameters are made simultaneously by same API app for same user. If your app implements retry logic, please hold off the retry until the previous request finishes. Parameters: Name Type Description arg FilesListFolderArg The request parameters. Returns: Type Promise.&lt;FilesListFolderResult, Error.&lt;FilesListFolderError&gt;&gt; filesListFolderContinue(arg) Once a cursor has been retrieved from list_folder, use this to paginate through all files and retrieve updates to the folder, following the same rules as documented for list_folder.

Use upload_session/start and upload_session/append_v2 to upload file contents. We recommend uploading many files in parallel to increase throughput. Once the file contents have been uploaded, rather than calling upload_session/finish, use this route to finish all your upload sessions in a single request. UploadSessionStartArg.close or UploadSessionAppendArg.close needs to be true for the last upload_session/start or upload_session/append_v2 call. This route will return a job_id immediately and do the async commit job in background. Use upload_session/finish_batch/check to check the job status.

This call starts a new upload session with the given data. You can then use upload_session/append_v2 to add more data and upload_session/finish to save all the data to a file in Dropbox. A single request should not upload more than 150 MB. An upload session can be used for a maximum of 48 hours. Attempting to use an UploadSessionStartResult.session_id with upload_session/append_v2 or upload_session/finish more than 48 hours after its creation will return a UploadSessionLookupError.not_found.
